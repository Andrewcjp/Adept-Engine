RHI:
RHI Command List is a wrapper around a DirectX 12 command list.
	D3D12CommandList holds the implementation for D3D12.
	
The D3D12 project holds all DirectX 12 code.

Rendering:
Rendering code is in Source/Core/Rendering
Shadow techniques are in the Shadow Renderer class.
SFR is implemented in the forward and deferred renderer classes.
MultiGPUMode struct (in RenderSettings.h) controls which technique is active.
LevelBenchmarker class controls running the benchmark 
	The Setup function adds the test cases.

Shaders:
Shaders are in /Shaders
Shader classes define source files in use (.HLSL) and the parameters for the shader.
The shader complier complies all shaders and stores the permutations for each one.


Running the engine:
Only the packages run the Benchmark.
The benchmark will sequentially loop though all the techniques.

F1 - Show FPS
F2 - Show stats
F3 - Show timeline
