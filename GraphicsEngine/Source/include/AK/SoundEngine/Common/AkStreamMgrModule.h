			///		from the streaming device's thread. If it wishes to open it now, then it must
			///		set io_bSyncOpen to true. Otherwise, it needs to do the following: leave 
			///		io_bSyncOpen to false, clear out_fileDesc::iFileSize and out_fileDesc::uSector, 
			///		and set out_fileDesc::deviceID to the streaming device's ID that will handle 
			///		this file. By returning io_bSyncOpen as false, the Stream Manager will interpret
			///		this as a request for deferred file opening, and this function will called again
			///		from the streaming device's thread (this time, with this io_bSyncOpen set to true).
			///		- All members of out_fileDesc will be cleared upon first call to Open().
			/// \warning
			///		- It is illegal to return io_bSyncOpen as false if Open() was called with io_bSyncOpen
