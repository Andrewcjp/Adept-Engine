The ShaderBindingTable is a helper to construct the SBT. It helps to maintain the
proper offsets of each element, required when constructing the SBT, but also when filling the
dispatch rays description.

Example:


D3D12_GPU_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE srvUavHeapHandle = m_srvUavHeap->GetGPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart();
UINT64* heapPointer = reinterpret_cast< UINT64* >(srvUavHeapHandle.ptr);

m_sbtHelper.AddRayGenerationProgram(L"RayGen", {heapPointer});
m_sbtHelper.AddMissProgram(L"Miss", {});

m_sbtHelper.AddHitGroup(L"HitGroup",
{(void*)(m_constantBuffers[i]->GetGPUVirtualAddress())});
m_sbtHelper.AddHitGroup(L"ShadowHitGroup", {});


// Create the SBT on the upload heap
uint32_t sbtSize = 0;
m_sbtHelper.ComputeSBTSize(GetRTDevice(), &sbtSize);
m_sbtStorage = nv_helpers_dx12::CreateBuffer(m_device.Get(), sbtSize,
D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_NONE, D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ,
nv_helpers_dx12::kUploadHeapProps);

m_sbtHelper.Generate(m_sbtStorage.Get(), m_rtStateObjectProps.Get());


//--------------------------------------------------------------------
Then setting the descriptor for the dispatch rays become way easier
//--------------------------------------------------------------------

D3D12_DISPATCH_RAYS_DESC desc = {};
// The layout of the SBT is as follows: ray generation shaders, miss shaders,
hit groups. As
// described in the CreateShaderBindingTable method, all SBT entries have the
same size to allow
// a fixed stride.

// The ray generation shaders are always at the beginning of the SBT. In this
// example we have only one RG, so the size of this SBT sections is
m_sbtEntrySize. uint32_t rayGenerationSectionSizeInBytes =
m_sbtHelper.GetRayGenSectionSize(); desc.RayGenerationShaderRecord.StartAddress
= m_sbtStorage->GetGPUVirtualAddress();
desc.RayGenerationShaderRecord.SizeInBytes = rayGenerationSectionSizeInBytes;

// The miss shaders are in the second SBT section, right after the ray
generation shader. We
// have one miss shader for the camera rays and one for the shadow rays, so this
section has a
// size of 2*m_sbtEntrySize. We also indicate the stride between the two miss
shaders, which is
// the size of a SBT entry
uint32_t missSectionSizeInBytes = m_sbtHelper.GetMissSectionSize();
desc.MissShaderTable.StartAddress =
m_sbtStorage->GetGPUVirtualAddress() + rayGenerationSectionSizeInBytes;
desc.MissShaderTable.SizeInBytes = missSectionSizeInBytes;
desc.MissShaderTable.StrideInBytes = m_sbtHelper.GetMissEntrySize();

// The hit groups section start after the miss shaders. In this sample we have 4
hit groups: 2
// for the triangles (1 used when hitting the geometry from a camera ray, 1 when
hitting the
// same geometry from a shadow ray) and 2 for the plane. We also indicate the
stride between the
// two miss shaders, which is the size of a SBT entry
// #Pascal: experiment with different sizes for the SBT entries
uint32_t hitGroupsSectionSize = m_sbtHelper.GetHitGroupSectionSize();
desc.HitGroupTable.StartAddress =
m_sbtStorage->GetGPUVirtualAddress() + rayGenerationSectionSizeInBytes +
missSectionSizeInBytes; desc.HitGroupTable.SizeInBytes = hitGroupsSectionSize;
desc.HitGroupTable.StrideInBytes = m_sbtHelper.GetHitGroupEntrySize();
